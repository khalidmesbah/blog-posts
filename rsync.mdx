# what is Rsync

Rsync is a powerful tool that facilitates the transfer and synchronization of data between both local and remote systems.

In Arch Linux, it's a valuable resource for managing and backing up files.

## Installation on arch

Rsync comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions.

However, if it's not available, you can install it using the package manager in Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S rsync
```
