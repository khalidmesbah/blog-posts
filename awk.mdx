# Notes

- Awk, a scripting language created in the late 70s, provides a simple and powerful way to explore data by enabling users to quickly analyze and manipulate text files through pattern-matching and action-based commands.
- It is a powerful tool for automating tasks and performing text manipulation.
- AWK is widely used in Unix-based systems and is available on most Linux distributions.
- It can search for patterns and replace strings.
- It can print specific columns and rows.
- It's a powerful tool for shell scripting.
- It's a good tool for system administration.
- Both Awk and Grep are powerful tools for data exploration and manipulation, particularly in Unix and Linux environments.
- Grep is a simpler version of Awk that searches for patterns (regular expressions) and prints matching lines.
- Awk operates on a line-by-line basis, executing commands on each line of a file.
- Awk uses a pattern-matching and action-based paradigm, automatically iterating through files, lines, and patterns.
