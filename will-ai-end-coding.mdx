## Why AI will not replace software engineers

### it's a lot more than just writing code

it's about impacting the end user which includes

- building and updating features
- fixing bugs
- doing Q/A
- improving processes
- attend meetings to clarify things
- asking questions to make sure you're on the right path

and ...etc

there's a whole ecosystem of stuff you have to manage

### AI gives only suggestions

and most of the time they are wrong, AI doesn't say no, but gives random answers
