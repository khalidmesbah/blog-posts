## Why AI will not replace software engineers

if ai has replaced software engineers, then it has elready replaced all jobs

programming is last job that will be replaced by ai

AI will replace software engineers when it has the ability to think like software engineers, and that's impossible because we don't know how humans think in first place to make an AI program that thinks like humans

### it's a lot more than just writing code

it's about impacting the end user which includes

- building and updating features
- fixing bugs
- doing Q/A
- improving processes
- attend meetings to clarify things
- asking questions to make sure you're on the right path

and ...etc

there's a whole ecosystem of stuff you have to manage

### AI gives only suggestions

and most of the time they are wrong, AI doesn't say no, but gives random answers

### obsiticales

- not enough electricity
- not enough money
- the queries of ai costs a lot of money and power
