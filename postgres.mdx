## what is postgres

- postgres === postgreSQL
- relational, SQL type database
- k

## why postgres

- Availability - It is open source and free to use with any project
- Common - It is a relational, SQL database which is the most common type of database right now
- Popular and well tested - Postgres is a very popular database, and a common choice among enterprise software
- Transferable skills - Because Postgres uses SQL, what you learn with Postgres is entirely transferable to working with a MySQL database or any other SQL database

## the primary key column

- it is most common to have an id column to be the primary key column for a table
- `id serial primary key` is used to differentiate between different rows that may be identical
- serial: the values will of the id column will be auto-incrementaing and one greater than the row previous
- The Primary Key is a piece of information unique to each row, often an ID.
- a table column whose values are
  - an auto incrementing number
  - guaranteed to be unique
- a column with unique identifiers for each row in a table

## the foreign key column

- The Foreign Key is a column that relates each row to in the table to the primary key of another table
- a reference to the primary key of another table

### why foreign keys

- create a relationship between data in one table with data in another table
- to connect information from from different tables
- allow queries to span multiple tables
- Having a foreign key allows us to query for relationships between two tables of data

## How to install postgres on arch

look at this useful [gist](https://gist.github.com/NickMcSweeney/3444ce99209ee9bd9393ae6ab48599d8)

## How enter the interactive terminal for working with Postgres.

By writing the command `psql <username>`

## notes

- data stored in postgres database doesn't have an order, it's not sorted, the data is just essentially in whatever order it was inserted into the table
- `su postgres` This switches the terminal user from Root (the default) to postgres, which we will use to access the database.
- `psql postgres` This will enter you into the interactive postgres terminal. Happy Experimenting!
- Database names should use underscores
- the power of data comes from being able to create and find relationship in the information we collect
- Part of being a software developer (and this really applies for both front and back end developers) is being able to translate abstract ideas for features or apps into concrete data structures.
- No where is this more true than in database design. It can be hard to take abstract ideas, identify their data needs, and meet those needs with tables and columns.
