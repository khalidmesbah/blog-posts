- data stored in postgres database doesn't have an order, it's not sorted, the data is just essentially in whatever order it was inserted into the table
- `su postgres` This switches the terminal user from Root (the default) to postgres, which we will use to access the database.
- `psql postgres` This will enter you into the interactive postgres terminal. Happy Experimenting!
- Database names should use underscores
-
