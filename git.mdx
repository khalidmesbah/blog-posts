## Terminology

### source code manager / version control system

A version control system (abbreviated as VCS) or A source code manager (abbreviated as SCM) is a tool that manages different versions of source code.

### git

- a distributed version control system (VCS) which is a software that helps you control (or manage) the different versions of something (typically source code).
- Git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it.

### commit

- a snapshot, Git thinks of its data like a set of snapshots of a mini file system.
- Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a
  picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that
  snapshot.
- git records changes to files as commits
- the commits are saved in the repository
- a good philosophy is to commit early and commit often
- The goal is that each commit has a single focus.
- Each commit should record a single-unit change. Now this can be a bit subjective (which is totally fine), but each commit should make a change to just one aspect of the project.

#### writing a good commit message

The best way that I've found to come up with a commit message is to finish this phrase, "This commit will...". However, you finish that phrase, use that as your commit message.

Do

- do keep the message short (less than 60-ish characters)
- do explain what the commit does (not how or why!)
- Above all, be consistent in how you write your commit messages!

Don't

- do not explain why the changes are made (more on this below)
- do not explain how the changes are made (that's what git log -p is for!)
- do not use the word "and", if you have to use "and", your commit message is probably doing too many changes - break the changes into separate commits

When you're writing the commit message, the first line is the message itself. After the message, leave a blank line, and then type out the body or explanation including details about why the commit is needed (e.g. URL links).

### repository

- A repository is a directory which contains your project work, as well as a few files which are used to communicate with Git.
- Repositories can exist either locally on your computer or as a remote copy on another computer.
- A repository is made up of commits.

### checkout

A checkout is when content in the repository has been copied to the Working Directory.

### Staging Area / Staging Index / Index

- A file in the Git directory that stores information about what will go into your next commit.
- You can think of the staging area as a prep table where Git will take the next commit.
- Files on the Staging Index are poised to be added to the repository.

### SHA

- A SHA is basically an ID number for each commit.
- Here's what a commit's SHA might look like: e2adf8ae3e2e4ed40add75cc44cf9d0a869afeb6.
- It is a 40-character string composed of characters (0–9 and a–f) and calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in Git.
- "SHA" is shorthand for "Secure Hash Algorithm".

### Branch

- A branch is when a new line of development is created that diverges from the main line of development.
- This alternative line of development can continue without altering the main line.

## What are the types of version control system models

There are two main types of version control system models:

1. the centralized model - all users connect to a central, master repository
2. the distributed model - each user has the entire repository on their computer

## What is the difference between git and github

git: version control tool
github: service that hosts git projects

## examples of VCSs

- git
- subversion
- mercurial

## What is the use of a VCS/SCM

- help you maintain a detailed history of the project as well as the ability to work on different versions of it.
- allows you to:
- revert files back to a previous state
- revert the entire project back to a previous state
- review changes made over time
- see who last modified something that might be causing a problem
- who introduced an issue and when

## What are the types of version control system models

There are two main types of version control system models:

2. the distributed model - each user has the entire repository on their computer

## Why having a detailed history of a project is important

because it

- lets you see the progress of the project over time.
- If needed, you can also jump back to any point in the project to recover data or files.

## `.git`

- contains all the necessary files and directories that git will use to keep track of everything
- This .git directory is the "repo"!
- This is where git records all of the commits and keeps track of everything!
- This .git directory is the brain/storage center for the repository.
- It holds all of the configuration files and directories and is where all of the commits are stored.
- If you want to back up or clone your repository, copying this single directory elsewhere gives you nearly everything you need.

### some of the contents of the `.git` directory

- config file - where all project specific configuration settings are stored.
- description file - this file is only used by the GitWeb program.
- hooks directory - this is where we could place client-side or server-side scripts that we can use to hook into Git's different lifecycle events
- info directory - contains the global excludes file
- objects directory - this directory will store all of the commits we make
- refs directory - this directory holds pointers to commits (basically the "branches" and "tags")

## globbing

Globbing lets you use special characters to match patterns/characters.

In the .gitignore file, you can use the following:

- blank lines can be used for spacing
- `#` - marks line as a comment
- - - matches 0 or more characters
- ? - matches 1 character
- [abc] - matches a, b, or c
- ** - matches nested directories - a/**/z matches
  - a/z
  - a/b/z
  - a/b/c/z
-

## tags

it's used to add a marker on a specific commit aka to label commits

### types of tags

- annotated flag
  - Annotated tags are recommended because they include a lot of extra information such as:
    - the person who made the tag
    - the date the tag was made
    - a message for the tag
- lightweight flag

Running `git tag -a v1.0` will tag the most recent commit.

But what if you wanted to tag a commit that occurred farther back in the repo's history?

All you have to do is provide the SHA of the commit you want to tag! `git tag -a v1.0 a87984`

the git tag command is used to add a marker on a specific commit.

The tag does not move around as new commits are added.

## branches

the branch moves when a new commit is added

when you create a new branch it will not be the current one automatically

A branch is used to do development or make a fix to the project that won't affect the project (since the changes are made on a branch).
Once you make the change on the branch, you can combine that branch into the master branch

One thing to note is that you can't delete a branch that you're currently on.
So to delete the sidebar branch, you'd have to switch to either the master branch or create and switch to a new branch.

branches let us work in isolation from the rest of the project

- `git branch` list all branch names in the repository
- `git branch <branch-name>` create a new branch
- `git branch -d <branch-name>` delete a branch
- `git branch -D <branch-name>` force delete a branch (never use this)
- `git branch -m <new-branch-name>` rename the checked-out branch
- `git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>` rename a non-head branch
- `git checkout <branch-name>` switch to a branch if it exists
- `git -b checkout <branch-name>` switch to a branch and create it if not exists
- `git switch <branch-name>` switch the between branches
- `git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all` Running this command will show all branches and commits in the repository:
- `git push origin --delete <branch-name>` delete a branch in a remote repository

## merging

- one a merge happens it makes a commit and the merge commit will happen on the head branch
- integrating changes from another branches into your current local head branch
- making a merge makes a commit
- When a merge happens, Git will:
  - look at the branches that it's going to merge
  - look back along the branch's history to find a single commit that both branches have in their commit history
  - combine the lines of code that were changed on the separate branches together
  - makes a commit to record the merge
- `git merge <name-of-branch-to-merge-in>` is used to combine Git branches:
- Whichever branch the special HEAD pointer is pointing at, that's the branch that will have the merge commit.
- hel
- which one is this

### types of merges

- regular merge
- fast-forword merge

## revert a commit

- `git revert` command is used to reverse a previously made commit:
- will undo the changes that were made by the provided commit
- creates a new commit to record the change

## reset a commit

## Questions

- what is a clean repository
  If your Working Directory is clean then there aren't any uncommitted changes in the repository

## notes

- `git init`: git is a command and init is a sub command
- `mkdir -p udacity-git-course/new-git-project && cd $_`: the `$_` part is sneaky
- `git log -p` === `git show`
- `git init`: convert a directory into a git repository
- If you've already run git init before it's ok – running git init multiple times doesn't cause any problems since it just re-initializes the Git directory.
- for Git to track a file, it needs to be committed to the repository
- for a file to be committed, it needs to be in the Staging Index
- the git add command is used to move files from the Working Directory to the Staging Index
- The text "Initial commit" isn't special, but it's the de facto commit message for the very first commit.
- `$ git commit -m "Initial commit"`: the text "Initial commit" is used as the commit message. Be aware that you can't provide a description for the commit, only the message part.
- `.png` will match `trees.png` and `trees.PNG`
- the .gitignore file is used to tell Git about the files that Git should not track.
- a tag is an extra label for a commit that indicates useful information
- a tag lets you point out particular commits to make them stand out from others, e.g: `git tag -a v1.0`
- a tag stays locked to a commit even even as more commits are added to the repository
- `git init`: create a new repository
- `git clone`: copy an existing repository
- `git log`: review existing commits
- `git status`: to see the status of a repository
- `git add`: add files from the working directory to the staging index
- `git commit`: take files from the staging index and save them in the repository
- `git diff`: displays the difference between two versions of a file
- `git diff`: command can be used to see changes that have been made but haven't been committed, yet.
- `git tag`: add tags to specific commits
- `git tag`: ineract with the repository's tags
- `git tag`: display all the tags that are in the repository
- `git branch`: create branches that let you develop different features of your project in parallel
- `git checkout`: switch between different branches and tags
- `git merge`: combines changes in different branches
- `git tag -d v1.0`: delete a tag
- ``:
- CAREFUL: In the command above (git tag -a v1.0) the -a flag is used. This flag tells Git to create an annotated flag. If you don't provide the flag (i.e. git tag v1.0) then it'll create what's called a lightweight tag.
- you should always use annotated tags.
- tags are associated with a specific commit. This is why the tag is on the same line as the commit's SHA.
- `-d === --delete`
- `^` relative commit reference
- `git reset --hard HEAD^` : undo the merge
- git doesn't allow you to rename a remote repo
- it's not possible to create a new branch in a remote repository, but we can publish an existing local branch on a remote repo
- `git commit --amend` alter the most recent commit (change the message, include files (or changes to files) you might've forgotten to include)
- Git does keep track of everything for about 30 days before it completely erases anything
