## Introduction

- Linux originally had no standard file system structure.
- Understanding the Linux file system structure is crucial for navigation and control.
- The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) provides a consistent directory structure.
- Linux distributions may add custom tweaks to the FHS.

## Notes

- usr stands for Unix System Resources, not user.
- Use the PATH variable to specify default binaries.
- The PATH variable can be reordered to specify default binaries.
- Use LD_LIBRARY_PATH to tweak the library search order.
- Keep user data in /home and admin data in /root.
- /run is used by system services for ongoing communication.
- Regularly inspect /var/log for hardware events and security issues.
- /proc and /sys are useful for performance tuning and forensic triage.
- /bin, /usr/bin, and /usr/local/bin serve as homes for different types of executables.
- /lib and /usr/lib hold shared libraries essential for binary functionality.

## The hierarchy

- `/bin` contains core OS programs (base OS binaries) accessible before /usr mounts.
- `/usr/bin` is the primary home for non-base OS binaries.
- `/usr/local/bin` holds executables installed by admins from source.
- `/sbin` directory house sysadmin utilities requiring root access.
- `/lib` and `/usr/lib` contain shared library files for binaries.
- `/lib` contains shared library files essential for /bin and /sbin binaries.
- `/usr/lib` holds libraries for /usr binaries not critical for early system init.
- `/etc` controls services with configuration files.
- `/home` stores user data, while `/root` is exclusive to administrators.
- `/var` stores fast-changing data like logs and caches.
- `/run` contains volatile run-time info like systemd details.
- `/proc` and `/sys` provide system observability and configuration.
- `/proc` is oriented towards process/runtime statistics.
- `/sys` provides component/hardware access for monitoring and config.
- `dev` device files
- `tmp` temporary files
- `boot` boot loader files
- `opt` optional applications
- `mnt` mount directory
- `media` removable devices
- `srv` service data
