## technical writing

### Simplicity

- Short Sentences
- Reduce Jargons (culture-dependent words)
- Use familiar words
- Introduce Abbreviations and Acronyms first
  - e.g: News Aggregation Service (NAS)

### Factual (only facts)

- Talk facts
- Active Voice
- References for every fact
- Build reasoning instead of opinions
- Use Objective words instead of subjective words (few, more, robust, strong, weak, complex)
- Reduce fluff and corp speak
- Reduce ambiguity and increase assertions (must instead of should, will instead of may)
- Replace pronouns (not it ,he ,his)

### Organized

- Use bullet lists instead of Paragraphs
- Clear structure (Context, Problem, Findings, Solutions, Conclusion)

### Reduce cognitive fatigue

- Reduce colors and Formatting
- Have enough white spaces
- Reduce graph complexity
- Reduce duplicate sentences

### Guidelines

- If you canâ€™t read it, nobody can read it
- People attention is too short
