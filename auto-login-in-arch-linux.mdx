## open the following file 
```sh
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants/getty@tty1.service
```

## change the ExecStart variable to the following
```sh
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty -a {username} - $TERM
```

> please make sure you don't miss spell a word nor delete or add a character, beacuse my system tottaly crashed when i added an extra dash before the username and i had to use chroot ot change the root directory and fix the problem
> `ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty -a - {username} - $TERM` => this line broke my system
