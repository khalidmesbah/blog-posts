## ADT

- A theoretical concept, more like a logical or a mathematic view
- it's independent of programming languages and how it will be implemented
- Data structures are concrete, they are implementing the ADTs
- ADTs are acting like an interface
  - we as clients: use it based on the agreed provided functionality (interface)
  - the implementer: follow the agreed design (interface)
- ADTs are all about the what
- The implementation of ADTs is language dependent
