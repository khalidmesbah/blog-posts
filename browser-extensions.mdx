## What is a browser extension?

it's a piece of functionality that a browser doesn't have by default

At a very basic level, a Chrome extension is just some HTML, CSS and JavaScript that allows you to add some functionality to Chrome through some of the JavaScript APIs Chrome exposes.

An extension is basically just a web page that is hosted within Chrome and can access some additional APIs.

## Notes when creating a browser extensions

- Chrome extensions can also be created to work only on certain pages through the use of Page Actions,

- Chrome extensions can also be created to work only on certain pages through the use of Page Actions, they can run code in the background using Background Pages, and they can even modify an existing page loaded in the browser using Content Scripts.

- Due to security constraints, we can’t put inline JavaScript into our HTML files inside of our Chrome extensions, so we have to create a separate file to hold any JavaScript code we need and we’ll reference it from the HTML file.

- Chrome extensions work by using either page actions or browser actions.

A page action is an action that is specific to certain pages.

A browser action is relevant no matter where you are in the browser.

## How to create a Chrome extension

### `manifest.json`

All Chrome extensions require a manifest file.
The Manifest file tells Chrome everything it needs to know to properly load up the extension in Chrome.

## Service Workers

- service workers: a JavaScript file that runs separately from the main browser thread
- service workers will not have access to a webpage, since it's separate from main processes
- service workers have the capibality to communicate to your extension using the extension managing system

## Content Scripts

files that run in the context of the webpages we're on

## 2

- page actions => work only on certain pages
- background pages => run code in the background
- content script => modify an existing page loaded in the brow
