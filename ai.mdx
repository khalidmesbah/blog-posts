## Types of AI

1. Artificial narrowed intelligence
2. Artificial general intelligence
3. Artificial super intelligence

## How AI Learns

Through machine learning and deep learning

## Definition of Artificial intelligence

Programs with the ability to learn and reason like humans.

Artificial intelligence leverages computers and machines
to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making
capabilities of the human mind.

Any technique that enables computers to mimic human intelligence.

## Definition of Machine learning

A program that uses input data to train a model, and then trained model can make predictions based on data that it hasn't seen before

Algorithms with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

A subset of AI that includes techniques that enables machines to improve at tasks with experience

### Supervised V.S. Unsupervised machine learning

- supervised models use labeled data
- unsupervised models use unlabeled data

## Definition of Deep learning

A type of machine learning that uses Artificial neural networks

Subset of machine learning in which artificial neural networks adapt and learn from vast amounts of data

A subset of machine learning based on neural networks that permit a machine to train itself to perform a task

## Prerequisites

- statistics
- probability
- programming
- data structures
- algorithms
- calculus
- linear algebra
- databases
- operating systems
- a programming language: Python or Java or Prolog or R

## Notes

- machine learning deals with data that can be stored in a spreadsheet. (structured data)
- deep learning deals with data that can not be stored in a spreadsheet like videos, images and audios. (unstructured data)
- algorithms of deep learning runs on the GPU
- AI consists of two parts
  - one responsible for understanding the question
  - one responsible for answering the question
- matrices are functions
