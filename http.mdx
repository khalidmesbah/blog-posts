## What is The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

It is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

## HTTP request methods

HTTP defines a set of request methods (HTTP verbs) to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.

Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

- `GET` The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
- `HEAD` The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.
- `POST` The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
- `PUT` The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
- `DELETE` The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
- `CONNECT` The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
- `OPTIONS` The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.
- `TRACE` The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
- `PATCH` The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.

## RESTful APIs Routes

- Index Route: `GET /books`
  - return all the items of a database table
- Show Route: `GET /books:id`
  - returns a single item
- Create Route: `POST /books`
  - returns the newly created item
- Edit/Update Route: `PUT /books:id or PATCH /books:id`
  - returns the updated item
- Delete Route: `DELETE /books:id`
  - returns the deleted item

## Why REST is useful

For providing a predictable, industry standard, well-organized way to structure API endpoints.
