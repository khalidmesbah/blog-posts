## What is The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

It is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

- responsible for communication between web servers and clients

## HTTP request methods

HTTP defines a set of request methods (HTTP verbs) to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.

Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

- `GET`
  - retrieves data from the server
  - The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
- `POST`
  - submits data to the server
  - The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
- `PUT`
  - update data already on the server
  - The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
- `DELETE`
  - delete data from the server
  - The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
- `CONNECT` The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
- `OPTIONS` The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.
- `TRACE` The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
- `PATCH` The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.
- `HEAD` The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.

## HTTP header fields

### General Header Fields:

- Cache-Control
- Connection
- Date
- Pragma
- Trailer
- Transfer-Encoding
- Upgrade
- Via

### Response-Specific Header Fields:

- Accept-Ranges
- Age
- Content-Encoding
- Content-Language
- Content-Length
- Content-Location
- Content-Type
- Expires
- Last-Modified
- Server
- Set-Cookie

### Request-Specific Header Fields:

- Accept
- Accept-Encoding
- Accept-Language
- Authorization
- Content-Length
- Content-Type
- Cookie
- Host
- Referer
- User-Agent

## HTTP status code

### General

- 1xx: informational
- 2xx: success
- 3xx: redirect
- 4xx: client error
- 5xx: server error

### Most popular

- 200: ok
- 201: ok created
- 301: moved to new url
- 304: not modified (cached version)
- 400: bad request
- 401: unauthorized
- 404: not found
- 500: internal server error

## RESTful APIs Routes

- Index Route: `GET /books`
  - return all the items of a database table
- Show Route: `GET /books:id`
  - returns a single item
- Create Route: `POST /books`
  - returns the newly created item
- Edit/Update Route: `PUT /books:id or PATCH /books:id`
  - returns the updated item
- Delete Route: `DELETE /books:id`
  - returns the deleted item

## Why REST is useful

For providing a predictable, industry standard, well-organized way to structure API endpoints.

## Notes

- every request is independent
- http is stateless
- each request consist of a header and a body
