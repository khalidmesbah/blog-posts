## i know

- `killall` terminate a program, not the best so you can check `bpytop`
- `touch` create a file, modify the access time of a file
- `which` where a program is
- `ping` test network
- `less <file>` or `cat <file> | more` better than cat when creating long files
- `sudo blkid` list all the devices on a machine, find the uuid for a device
- `sudo -s` act as a root for some time instead of typing sudo every time
- `su <user>` change user
- `sudo` allows us to act as the root user

## Piping / chaining

`ls | cat` allowing the standard output from the `ls` command to be the standard input for the `cat` command
e.g: `cat contacts.txt | sort | uniq | grep something`

## running multiple commands at once

1. using `;` run both commands
2. using `&&` run the second command if the first succeeds
3. using `||` run the second command if the first fails

e.g: `mkdir hi && cd hi`

## the find command

`find <locationToSearch> `

## redirection

Redirecting the output into a file

`echo hi > hi.txt` overwrite redirection
`echo hi >> hi.txt` append redirection
e.g: `sort < contacts.txt > sorted-contacts.txt`

## sudo

`sudo !!` Run `sudo` to the previous command
