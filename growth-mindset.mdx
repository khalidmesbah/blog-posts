## What are the types of mindsets

## What people with fixed mindset do

- they think that talents are sufficient to get ahead in life and they don't need any improvements because of them
- they rely on their innate talents and characteristics and experience an inner resistance toward developming new features or skills they don't already have or lack a natural talent for
- they believe that their potential is predetermined

## What people with growth mindset do

- they believe that talents and abilities can be developed through dedication, practise, and continuous improvements; they're not fixed
- they accept challenges and see them as ways of personal development
- they embrace failure, and welcome feedback and criticism
- they seek challenges, and thrive on it
