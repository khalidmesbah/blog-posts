## what is a database

- a usually large collection of data organized especially for rapid search and retrieval
- Databases are organized data storage (often, but not exclusively for computers)
-

## the use of databases

- store information in an organized way to make data useful
- How a database is organized is dependent on how the information it stores will be used
-

## forms of the databases

What makes it hard to talk about databases is how many different forms they can take

they can be in any form

e.g:

- digital database that is consumed by an application
- library
- physical ledger book
- a text file
- a spreedsheet of addresses
- the to-do sticky notes on my fridge
- ...etc

## most popular types of databases

### SQL/ relational databases

SQL type databases are organized to be query-able using SQL (Structured Query Language) and organize information in tables.

#### ideal usecases

Repeating, structured data, such as:

- user information
- product inventories
- blogs

#### Common SQL/Relational Database Technologies:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB
- Microsoft SQL Server

### NoSQL/ non-relational databases

These databases can take a few different forms and are used for large sets of distributed data (like for use in micro service architectures).

#### Ideal Use Cases:

Partially structured or un-structured data: really big collections of complex data, caches

#### Types of NoSQL Databases:

- Key-Value store
  A key-value store is a non-relational, noSQL database type that stores data in key-value pairs (exactly like objects or dictionaries in programming).
  These databases are fast because the keys are unique and easily searchable, and they are flexible, because these key value pairs can store any combination of data types required.
- Document store
  A document store is a non-relational, noSQL database type that organizes data into documents.
  Documents can hold any shape of data, which means document stores can easily handle data with no structure or that is arbitrarily nested, which can be a headache to account for in a relational way.
- Column-oriented
  Data organized by column instead of by row.
  This architecture scales easily and makes fast, efficient queries.
  I'm including this architecture as a NoSQL type dbms, but this architecture can actually be used with SQL as well.

#### Common NoSQL Database Technologies:

- Redis [Key Value store]
- MongoDB [Document store]
- Elasticsearch [Document store]
- Apache Cassandra [Column-oriented]

## schema

- the tables of a database, the columns and the column types of all of those tables can collectively be referred to as the schema
- describes the structure of a database
- the schema of a database is the tables of a database and their columns and column types
- the architecture or structure of a relational database, a statement of its tables and their columns

## resources

## notes

- Structure of a relational database table is like a spreadsheet with columns
