## Cleaning The Pacman cache

with each software update, Pacman fills up with lots of downloadable package files. To clear it out, open up a terminal window and use the following command to clear it out.

```sh
sudo paccache -r # completely empty all packages in the cache (unsafe)
sudo paccache -rk1 # manage the versions of programs to delete, rather than indiscriminately removing everything. a safe alternative to the line above.
sudo paccache -ruk0 # remove uninstalled Arch packages from the Pacman cache,
```

## Manage Startup Apps

Taking control of this aspect of your operating system is important because too many applications running at startup can quickly eat away at CPU resources and RAM.

```sh
cd ~/.config/autostart # list all the startup apps
rm example.desktop # remove a startup app
```

## Reduce Boot Delay

```sh
# open the grub file and change GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 to GRUB_TIMEOUT=0
sudo vim /etc/default/grub
# generate a new config:
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## Disable FSCK At boot

Use This Well-Tested Kernel Parameter (Also, Read the Warnings)

`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="fsck.mode=skip quiet loglevel=0 rd.systemd.show_status=false nowatchdog mitigations=off libahci.ignore_sss=1"`

```sh
# open the grub file and change the kernel parameter in the grub file
sudo vim /etc/default/grub
# generate a new config:
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## advices

- don't update packages a lot, just once a month
- don't install outdated packages
- keep backups
