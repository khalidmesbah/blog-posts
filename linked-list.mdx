## Linked List

- A linked list is a sequence of nodes
- A linked list is a series of connected nodes, where each node is a data structure.
- A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a series of nodes connected by pointers (in C or C++) or references (in Java, Python and JavaScript).
- Each node contains data and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list.
- Linked List is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) that holds a collection of Nodes
- The nodes are accessed in a sequential way.

## Types

### Singly Linke List

- When the Nodes are connected with only the next pointer the list is called.

### Doubly Linke List

- When the Nodes are connected with both the next pointer and prev pointer the list is called.

## Node

- A node is a structured variable (or object) containing at least one field whose type is a pointer type.
- Contains data and a link to the next node
- A data structure

## Head

- The first node

## Tail

- The last node

## Traversal

- Traversing a data structure: accessing each element of the data structure at least once
- Traversal is a common operation performed on data structures.
- It is the process in which each and every element present in a data structure is "visited" (or accessed) at least once.
- This may be done to display all of the elements or to perform an operation on all of the elements.
- The print function in a lined list is a traversal function because it iterates over all the elements of the linked list once
- We can code the traversal function iteratively or recursively
- Examples of traversal problems
  - min of all elements
  - max of all elements
  - sum of all elements
  - is_sorted
  - search for an element
  - get_nth

## Linked List ADT

## Advantages

★ A linked list can grow or shrink in size as the program runs. This is possible because the nodes in a linked list are dynamically allocated.
★ They can be used to implement other common abstract data types, including lists, stacks, queues, deque, and so on.
★ The advantage that linked lists have over vectors, is the speed at which a node may be inserted into or deleted from the list.

## Disadvantages

- No random access

## Linked lists VS Arrays

### Linked List

- Data Structure: Non-contiguous
- Memory Allocation: Typically allocated one by one to individual elements
- Insertion/Deletion: Efficient
- Access: Sequential

### Array

- Data Structure: Contiguous
- Memory Allocation: Typically allocated to the whole array
- Insertion/Deletion: Inefficient
- Access: Random
