# Programming paradigms

> Programming paradigms and examples of languages

## Programming paradigms types
- structural programing
- object oriented programing
- functional programing

# Programming languages types

## The way it's translated to machine code

- interpreted
  e.g: python, js
- compiled
  e.g: c, cpp, go
- assembly
  e.g: x86, Mips, Arm

## Similarity to machine

- high level language
- low level language
- machine language

## Notes

Assembly languages are processor-dependent

## What is a programming language

a set of instructions, commands and other syntax used to create a software program

## what ?

it's a way is the way of programming

## types

- imperative
  - procedural
  - object oriented
- functional
  - logical
  - mathematical
  - functional

## Types of programming languages

- Low-level programming languages
  - machine language === machine code === object code
  - assembly language
- High-level programming languages
  - procedural
  - object-oriented
  - natural language
- World Wide Web display languages
- Database programming languages
- Data-oriented languages
- Business-oriented languages
- Education-oriented languages
- Scripting languages
- Computational languages
- Numerical analysis languages

## Notes

- assembly language uses an assembler to convert the assembly language to machine language.
- The advantage of machine language is that it helps the programmer to execute the programs faster than the high-level programming language.
- The advantage of assembly language is that it requires less memory and less execution time to execute a program.
- The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain.
- The advantage of PP language is that it helps programmers to easily track the program flow and code can be reused in different parts of the program.
- The main advantage of object-oriented programming is that OOP is faster and easier to execute, maintain, modify, as well as debug.
- The main advantage of natural language is that it helps users to ask questions in any subject and directly respond within seconds.

### procedural programming

- derived from structured programming.
- based on structured programming.
- based upon the procedure call concept.
- a program is made of procedures.
- any procedure can be called anytime during execution.
- It divides a program into small procedures called routines or functions.

> procedures: given computational steps that need to be carried out

### object oriented programming

- based upon the objects.
- programs are divided into small parts called objects.
- used to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc in the program to makes the program reusable, efficient, and easy-to-use.

### functional programming

- based upon functions

### logical programming

- we write sentences in logical form

### Natural language

- part of human languages such as English, Russian, German, and Japanese.
- used by machines to understand, manipulate, and interpret human's language.
- used by developers to perform tasks such as translation, automatic summarization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), relationship extraction, and topic segmentation.

## Q&A

### what is imperative programming

instructing the machine how to change its state

### What is a language

- a type of communication for sharing ideas
