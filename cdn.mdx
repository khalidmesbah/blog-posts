## What does CDN stand for

- Content Delivery Network

## What is CDN

A geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users.

A network of servers linked together with the goal of delivering content as quickly, cheaply, reliably, and securely as possible.

## What does a CDN do

A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

## Is a CDN the same as a web host

While a CDN does not host content and canâ€™t replace the need for proper web hosting, it does help cache content at the network edge, which improves website performance.

Many websites struggle to have their performance needs met by traditional hosting services, which is why they opt for CDNs.

## What are the benefits of using a CDN

- Improving website load times
- Reducing bandwidth costs
- Increasing content availability and redundancy
- Improving website security
