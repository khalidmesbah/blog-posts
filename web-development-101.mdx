## Advices

- use a library only if you really need a lot of its functionalities - don't use a library for simple things
- choose the library with the least size and functionalities that fit your needs
- don't import libraries that you won't use in the current file - remove unused imports in the current file
- try to keep using the latest version of a library
- don't use different versions of the same library
- delete unused libraries
- use the minified version of the library
- don't use multiple library that do the same thing
- use the right library
