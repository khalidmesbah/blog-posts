## Introduction

## Traditional programming

### What is traditional programming

In traditional programming, a programmer writes explicit instructions (code) that tell the computer what to do.

### Use cases

-

### Advantages

- cheap
- always accurate 100%
- not biased
- easy to understand and interpret

### Disadvantages

### Examples of Programs

- websites
- databases
- programs like Mathematica and SPSS

### Popular languages

- Java and CPP

## AI programming

### What is AI programming

AI systems are trained on a large amount of data, allowing them to learn
patterns and make predictions or decisions based on that

### Use cases 2

- AI is used in situations where it would be too complex or impractical to write
  traditional code, like natural language processing, image recognition,
  and predictive modeling. AI can also be used in systems that need to adapt to new information, like recommendation algorithms.

### Advantages 2

- solves problems that traditional programming cannot solve

### Disadvantages 2

- AI algorithms require large amounts of data to train effectively
- difficult to understand and interpret than traditional code
- AI models are biased
- Not always accurate
- Expensive

### Examples

- Chatgpt
- self-driving cars

### Popular languages

- R and Python
