## What is a type?

```ts
type PersonT = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

## What is an interface?

```ts
interface PersonI {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

# Types vs Interfaces

- types are versatile which means that there are more ways to use them => (types++)
- interfaces have one feature that types do not have => (interfaces++)
- types are less complicated => (types++)
  - interfaces are a tiny bit faster than types, in other words, they are faster to compile but the difference is negligible => (interfaces++)
- types have more features => (types++)
  - the ability to merge interfaces but not types => (interfaces++)
- types can be used for everything without the need of interfaces (interfaces can only describe objects) => (types++)
- interfaces have shorter and more focused error messages => (interfaces++)
- types are easier to read and write (cleaner) => (types++)
- the word `type` has 4 characters meanwhile `interface` has 9 => (types+=4)
- using any of them is not a big of a deal they both works fine => (types++, interfaces++)

## Conclusion

In a nutshell, be consistent and always favor types over interfaces.

Points:

`Types` : 10
`interfaces` : 5
