## learn to read code

- Be comfortable with reading others' code and understanding it
- Coding projects from scratch while learning a specific technology is a big waste of time
- just code the part you're interested in
- if you want to learn a specific technology and you're following along a course that teaches you that technology,
- stop trying to code the whole project from scratch, instead just download the source code and code only the part you
  want to learn not the whole project
